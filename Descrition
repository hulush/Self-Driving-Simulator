Language: Python
Environment: Keras With Theano (Tensorflow)
Optional : Anaconda Package (Recommended)

GOAL
The goal of the project was to train a Deep Learning to replicate the human steering behaviour while driving, thus being able to drive autonomously on a simulator provided by Simulator (Udacity). 
 -  Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behaviour
 -  Design, train and validate a model that predicts a steering angle from image data
 -  Use the model to drive the vehicle autonomously around the first track in the simulator.


Code structure
model.py: model definition and training
model.h5 (a trained Keras model) model weights
drive.py: interaction with the simulator (actually drive the car)
Environments.yml: conda environment (Use TensorFlow without GPU)
utils.py: The script to provide useful functionalities (image pre-processing and augmentation)
